<font style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> <h2>III || As we approach the limit.</h2> </font>


<font style="font-family:'Courier New'"> <em><p>The sound of ringing echoes in the forest.<br />
Neither was it bell nor chime.<br />
It was blades clashing; two people fighting.<br />
As they hold their blades, they wish to fight hand-to-hand. <br /> </p>

<p>For they cannot activate their abilities without touching the other.<br />
Paradoxical, it may seem, but they shan't cross another,<br />
For they cannot have their abilities activated or one will be incapacitated.<br />
As their blades continue to clash into the dead of night...<br /> </p>

<p>Their blades are as nameless as those who wield them.<br />
There's nothing special about these, <br />
Nor their technique isn't particularly outstanding.<br />
Simply, they are fighting to survive.<br /> </p>

<p>For what purpose are they fighting for?<br />
This is pointless, there is no gain.<br />
Security? Money? Justice? Revenge?<br />
All of them has been abandoned long ago.<br />

<p>But this is important to the two...<br />
They cannot survive as long the other lives,<br />
One wishes to save others and one wishes to save themself.<br />
However neither is righteous; both are selfish.<br /> </p>

<p>This is a battle between the one who wishes upon a star, <br />
And another who gazes at it, desiring to reach it. <br />
Both are so similar yet so different. <br />
This difference will define the course of the worthless fight.<br /> </p>

<p>"You will forever chase a distant star. <br />
Running for miles will not lead you, <br />
You're approaching the limit, <br />
You will never reach it!"<br /> </p>

<p>"But it is possible to reach a star, <br />
It is physical, like this world that lives off of stardust. <br />
It is distant, yet attainable to those willing to reach it. <br />
Unlike you who chases something that isn't even real!"<br /> </p>

<p>They had reached their limit, <br />
One drops their weapon, <br />
And rushes towards their opponent. <br />
The battle is almost decided.<br /> </p>

<p>Their lack of skill bears blight. <br />
For the unarmed touches the armed, <br />
And activates their ability, <br />
It seems to be game over, for him, stargazer. <br /> </p> </em> </font>
