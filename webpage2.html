<font style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> <h2>II || My Life is a Triangle.</h2> </font>

<font style="font-family:'Courier New'"> <em><p>The view is triangular, <br />
Two points, ahead and above. <br />
Do not gaze the hypothenuse, <br />
It's too far, you can't reach it. <br /> </p>

<p>One of the legs, <br />
It will lead to the stars. <br />
Run toward the ends of the world, <br />
By then, you'll be your hero. <br /> </p>

<p>Stargazer, that is the end, <br />
Look up, one of the legs. <br />
Tomorrow will not be the same, <br />
For you, a day never passes.<br /> </p> </em> </font>
